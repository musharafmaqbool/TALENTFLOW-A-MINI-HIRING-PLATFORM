## How to Verify

### 1. Check Seed Data
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Open DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → TalentFlowDB
# Verify: 25 jobs, 1200 candidates, 3 assessments
```

### 2. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Open DevTools → Network tab
# Use the application
# See MSW intercepting all /api/* requests
# Observe 200-1200ms latency
# Watch for occasional 500 errors (~7.5%)
```

### 3. Verify Persistence
```bash
# Create a job
# Refresh page
# Job persists (from IndexedDB)
```

### 4. Test All Features
```bash
# Follow QUICK_START.md for 5-minute test
# Or use TESTING_GUIDE.md for comprehensive testing
```
